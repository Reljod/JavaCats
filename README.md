# JavaCats

A CLI Application that shows cute cats ðŸ˜ƒ.

## To run.
1. Run ```java -cp bin/ App``` or ctrl/cmd + F5 in VSCode.

## Motivation
This is my first time working with JAVA but I felt comfortable working on this because of my experience with other Statically typed, Object Oriented Programming Languages like C++ and C#.
